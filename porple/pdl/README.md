# PDL Directory 

This folder will contain any module templates that you want to override with your theme.
For more info on overriding templates, please check out the wiki: 
<https://www.fandom-federation.space/wiki/index.php/Hubzilla:Extending_a_Theme>

mod_channel.pdl is included as an example (the pdl is exactly the same as the default). 
You can find templates for other modules in the `view/pdl` folder of your Hubzilla install.
